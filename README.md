Drupal 8 Development Principles & Standards
====================================

This group is meant to be a collaborative, living document that identifies the
best practices and workflow decisions we have made for working with Drupal 8,
for both "core" and "contracts" projects.


Making changes
------------------------------------

To submit a change proposal, either

- create an issue that describes the proposed change
- create an issue, create a branch, commit changes referencing the issue, and
open a Pull request for team review.


GitHub usage
------------
Make use of the "Assignees" and "Reviewers" tags to make sure people are clear
who is expected to do what.
